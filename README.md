# LendingClubCaseStudy
## Business Understanding

You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

 

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## General Information

This project can be seen as a data science and machine learning case study aimed at understanding loan defaults, performing risk assessment, and providing business insights.

- The main goal of the project is to analyze Lending Club loan data to build predictive models that can assess the risk of loan defaults.
- Python scripts for cleaning and manipulating the data.
- Visualizations and statistical analysis to provide a detailed understanding of the data.
- A trained machine learning model capable of predicting loan defaults.
- A detailed report on the model's performance, including evaluation metrics and potential areas for improvement.
- A summary of the key insights derived from the data and how they can be applied in a business context.

## Technologies Used
- Python serves as the primary programming language, utilizing libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn help in generating insightful visual representations of the data.
- For machine learning, Scikit-Learn is used to build and evaluate predictive models.
- The entire workflow is conducted in Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting.
